# Java Swing Calculator

This repository contains a simple calculator application built using Java Swing for the graphical user interface. It performs basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Features

* **Basic Arithmetic Operations:** Supports addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).
* **Clear Display:** A text field displays the input and results.
* **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple and intuitive button layout.
* **Decimal Support:** Handles decimal numbers.
* **Error Handling:** Basic error handling for division by zero.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Java Development Kit (JDK) installed (version 8 or later recommended).
* An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans (optional, but recommended).

### Installation and Execution

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git)
    ```
    Replace `your-username/your-repository-name` with your actual repository details.

2.  **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
    ```bash
    cd your-repository-name
    ```

3.  **Compile the Java Code:**
    * If using an IDE, open the project and let the IDE handle compilation.
    * If using the command line, navigate to the `src` directory (or wherever your `.java` files are located) and compile using `javac`:
        ```bash
        javac Calculator.java
        ```
        (Replace `Calculator.java` with the name of your main Java file.)

4.  **Run the Application:**
    * From your IDE, run the main class.
    * From the command line, execute the compiled class:
        ```bash
        java Calculator
        ```
        (Replace `Calculator` with the name of your main class.)

## Usage

* Use the number buttons (0-9) to enter numbers.
* Use the operator buttons (+, -, \*, /) to perform arithmetic operations.
* Use the "=" button to display the result.
* Use the "C" button to clear the display.
* Use the "." button to add a decimal point.
